This repository contains some random/fun scripts

philosophy.py
============

This script plays the wikipedia philosophy game for you.

The philosophy game is as folows:
go to a random wikipedia page, 
klick the first link that isn't in between parentheses
arrive at the philosophy page.


There seems to be someone (or a group) of people in active battle to make this so
as I found a cycle with this script at the vehicle page I discovered some people were
desperatly trying to fix it and make it refer to the philosophy page. f.ex
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vehicle&diff=430039885&oldid=429859075)

anyway, have fun

caveats
-------
fails with utf-8/unicode errors on some pages
fix this for me plox?

the remove_parentheses function could perhaps be rewritten in a more pythonic way


Click.java
==========
This will click your mouse for infinity 
handy when playing a really boring game
